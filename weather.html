  <td align="middle"><h3>Weather is a factor in good images</h3>
    <p> Clouds on a very cloudy day act as a filter and allow photographs to be taken in midday. Normally
      the bright sun would prevent these photos. <br />
      Photographs taken in the rain or just after a rain have a different look. <br />
      Photos of lightning add a different view to familiar landscapes. <br />
      Falling snow can provide a different prospective to an image. <br />
      Weather is a factor in can we get to the location to take the image. <br />
      What do I need to take to protect my camera? From the cold? Rain? Snow? <br />
      Is it going to be windy when I want to photograph the flowers? <br />
      What kind of coat do I need to wear? </p>

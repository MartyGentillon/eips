  <p>The second meeting of the month is the Advancement Program, we ask the participant to   bring three digital images  or prints (8x10 or larger) to be evaluated   by other club members.&nbsp;The  images are judged on point system from 6 to   10. &nbsp;We comment on what is liked about the image  and also how an image   can be approached or done differently. &nbsp;The&nbsp;In other words, we are trying to have  a positive critiquing session.&nbsp;Since all members see every image, we have the advantage of finding out what other images   might be available for us to see  in this locality.&nbsp;Every other month is a theme presentation so that we can  find out how differently we each interpret that topic.&nbsp;This also makes a  scenic photographer shoot some still life or people pictures and the people  photographer look at other   parts of their viewfinder.&nbsp;Additionally, we would like for the image   to have been shot within the last two years so that  you continue to shoot photos and not just dip into your archives of past  photos.&nbsp;</p>

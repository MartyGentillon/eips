<p>The second meeting of the month is the Advancement Program, we ask the participant to bring three digital images or prints (8x10 or larger) to be evaluated by other club members. The images are judged on point system from 6 to 10. We comment on what is liked about the image and also how an image can be approached or done differently. The In other words, we are trying to have a positive critiquing session. Since all members see every image, we have the advantage of finding out what other images might be available for us to see in this locality. Every other month is a theme presentation so that we can find out how differently we each interpret that topic. This also makes a scenic photographer shoot some still life or people pictures and the people photographer look at other parts of their viewfinder. Additionally, we would like for the image to have been shot within the last two years so that  you continue to shoot photos and not just dip into your archives of past  photos.</p>

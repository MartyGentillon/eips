  <h3>October <span class="style4">Juried Show </span></h3>
  <p class="style4">Eastern Idaho Photographic Society has for over 25 years had a Juried Show in October. The purpose of the show is to have our photographs <br /> judged and then displayed for the public to view.  This is an educational and enjoyable experience for club members. <br />We encourage club members and others to enter their photographs in the show. </p>
  <p> Three judges from professional photographers in the community or nearby areas, instructors of photography, or individuals working in the photography industry <br />are selected to judge the show. The Best of show, First Place, Second Place, Third Place, and Fourth Place photographs are selected. <br /> In addition, a blue ribbon photograph and an honorable mention photograph are selected from each of the (optional) show categories. <br /> All entries are ranked by scores given by the judges and prizes are awarded. </p>
  <p> Photographs are hung for display for the general public to view.</p>

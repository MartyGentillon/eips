    Good Samaritan Society-Idaho Falls Village</a></p>
<p>The first meeting of the month is an educational presentation or workshop.<br>
   Bring your camera and tripod to the meeting.<br>
   Quite often we leave from Good Samaritan promptly at 7:45 to photograph at various locations. <br>
   The plan is to carpool if participants wish.</p>

<p>The second meeting focuses on "advancement topics."  We bring in photos for review by the group.  <br>
   The critiques are positive and designed to improve our skills as photographers.</p>

<p>EIPS members photograph wildlife, landscapes, and still lifes. Our favorite location  for landscapes and wildlife is <br>
   the national lands around Idaho Falls, such as Yellowstone Park.</p>
<p>The December 2010 issue of Outdoor Photographer had the top 25 places in the world to photograph landscapes. <br>
   Five of the locations are an average of 6 hours and 375 miles from Idaho Falls. While the furthest <br>
   is 603 miles (10 hours) away, the closest is only 149 miles (3 hours) away. </p>
<p>The June 2010 issue of Outdoor Photographers contest shows photographs of 100 landscapes in the world.<br>
   We have 3 within 200 miles of Idaho falls. </p>

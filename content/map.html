<h2>GPS Location Finders</h2>

<p>Photographers, unlike hunters or fishermen, will tell the exact location where a photograph was taken.  Other photographers can take a similar image, but the time of day, clouds, season, and many other things may have changed, so the second photographer's image most likely not be the same as the first.</p>
<p>The following links will help you find a location.</p>

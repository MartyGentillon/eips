<p>Photographers unlike hunters or fishermen, we will tell the exact location where a photograph was taken.</p>
<p>Other photographers can take a similar image, but the time of day, clouds, season, and many other things may have changed.</p>
<p>The second photographer's image most likely not be the same.</p>
<p>The second photographer may get a much different image by changed conditions.</p>
<p>These will help find a location.</p>

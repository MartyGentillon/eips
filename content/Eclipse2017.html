<h2>Photographing <br>The Great American Eclipse</h2>
<h4>Rocky Mountain Photo Council Lecture</h4>
<p>The Rocky Mountain Photo Council is a way for the clubs in Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming to inform each other of major events going in their areas.  In particular, the two photo clubs in Idaho Falls (EIPS and <a href="http://www.highdesertphotographers.com">High Desert Photographers</a>) are sponsoring a lecture by Jim Vail, a member of the Idaho Falls Astronomical Society, on June 29, 2017.  Mr. Vail has traveled around the world to view eclipses, and we are confident that we have much to learn from him.  His expertise is explained in the following article from the Idaho Falls Post-Register:</p>

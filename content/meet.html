<h2>EIPS Meetings</h2>

<p>EIPS meetings occur on the first and third Thursday of each month at 7:30 pm at the Good Samaritan Society home, 825 Whittier Circle in Idaho Falls, ID.</p>
<h3>First Thursday Meeting Activities</h3>
<p>At the first Thursday monthly meetings, the focus is on education and the practice of taking pictures. EIPS members sometimes go on outings or take pictures under conditions arranged at the meeting site such as pictures of objects under special lighting.  More information about the in-house meetings is in the link below.</p>

<p>Presentations are another possible activitiy, especially when the weather is too cold for picture taking outside.  Sometimes guest speakers are invited.  At other times, members pass photo tips to the rest of the club by making presentations.  The presentations may be about how to use photo software to improve one's images, or about other aspects of photography.  The link below leads to source materials for four of the past member presentations.</p>

<h3>Third Thursday Meeting Activities</h3>
<p>The second meeting of the month, on the third Thursday, is devoted to the Advancement Program. We ask the participants to bring three digital images or prints (8x10 or larger) to be evaluated by other club members. The images are judged on point system from 6 to 10. We comment on what is liked about the image and also how an image can be approached or done differently. We always seek a positive critiquing session. Since all members see every image, we have the advantage of finding out what other images might be available for us to see in a given locality. Every other month is a theme presentation so that we can find out how differently we each interpret the specified topic. The process tends to makes a scenic photographer shoot some still life or people pictures and the people photographer look at other parts of their viewfinder.

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Usually the first meeting of the year is a potluck at our normal meeting place and time.  After eating, we make awards for those whose "advancement" scores (based on the monthly critiques) are the highest.  A fun time is had by all.</p>
<p>We often do not meet for the first Thursday in July.  It is near the July 4 Independence Day holiday and many members are not available to come.  We might also miss a meeting if its timing conflicted with some special event that most of the members would want to attend instead.  An example of this situation is having the Eastern Idaho State Fair Photography Awards night occur on one of our regular meeting nights. </p>
<p>We maintain a list of email addresses for our members.  Email is often the most convenient way to notify us about schedule changes.  As the information becomes available, we will also post it on the club's FaceBook page and on this website. </p>

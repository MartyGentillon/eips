<!--October Show is at the top of the page, in the middle of the template.... this is a problem -->
<p>In addition to the bimonthly meetings, the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society is active in promoting the display of member images in a number of venues.  A primary display activity occurs after the annual October show is judged; the pictures are open for public viewing for most of the month of October at in the hallways of the main Eastern Idaho Technical College Adminsitration Building, 1600 S 25th E, Building 3.</p>

<p>Another area of club activity is field trips.  These can occur on weekends or other times when members are free to gather and travel to a more distant location than is possible during a regular first Thursday meeting night.  There have been no recent trips of this nature, but the link below describes some past locations that have been visited by the club and thus gives ideas for possible future ones.  The link also leads to field trip information, such as maps and websites containing weather information.</p>

<p> EIPS members also enjoy other activities, such as an annual club dinner where awards are presented for achievements earned during the second Thursday "Advancement" meetings.  Club members have been known to help at area school science fairs and Earth Day. </p>

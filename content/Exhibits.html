<h2>Exhibit Opportunities for EIPS Members</h2>
<p class="DefaultText" style='text-align:left'>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society is active in promoting the display of member images in a number of venues.  In its over 25 years of existence the EIPS has had over 250 shows/presentations of photography to the public in Idaho Falls. We have presented over 3400 images shown to the public in these shows.</p>
<p>  A primary display activity occurs after the annual October show is judged; the pictures are open for public viewing for most of the month of October at in the hallways of the main Eastern Idaho Technical College Adminsitration Building, 1600 S 25th E, Building 3.</p>

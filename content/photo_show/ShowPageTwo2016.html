<h1>October <span class="style4">Juried Show </span></h1>
<p align="center" class="style4">Eastern Idaho Photographic Society has for over 25 years had a Juried Show in October. The purpose of the show is to have our photographs <br />
  judged and then displayed for the public to view.  This is an educational and enjoyable experience for club members. <br />We encourage club members and others to enter their photographs in the show. </p>
<p> Three professional photographers, instructors of photography, or individuals working in the photography industry in the community or nearby areas <br />
  are selected to judge the show. The Best of Show, First Place, Second Place, Third Place, and Fourth Place photographs are selected. <br />
  In addition, a blue ribbon photograph is selected from each of the (optional) show categories. <br />If there are enough entries, an honorable mention is awarded in each show category.<br /> All entries are ranked by scores given by the judges and prizes are awarded. </p>
<p> Photographs are hung for display for the general public to view.</p>

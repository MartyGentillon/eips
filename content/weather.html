  <h3>Weather is a factor in good images</h3>
  <p>Clouds on a very cloudy day act as a filter and allow photographs to be taken in midday. Normally
      the bright sun would prevent these photos.<br>
      Photographs taken in the rain or just after a rain have a different look.<br>
      Photos of lightning add a different view to familiar landscapes.<br>
      Falling snow can provide a different prospective to an image.<br>
      Weather is a factor in can we get to the location to take the image.<br>
      What do I need to take to protect my camera? From the cold? Rain? Snow?<br>
      Is it going to be windy when I want to photograph the flowers?<br>
      What kind of coat do I need to wear?</p>

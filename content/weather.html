<h2>Weather is a Factor in Good Photography</h2>
<p>Clouds on a very cloudy day act as a filter and allow photographs to be taken in midday. Normally the bright sun would prevent these photos. On the other hand, photographs taken in the rain or just after a rain have a different look. So do photos with snow, or with lightning. The golden light of sunrise and sunset can add to the beauty of a photograph.  Wind can be a detracting weather element, especially when we are trying to photograph the wildflowers.</p>
<p> In addition to the results of the photography, weather is a factor in whether we can even get to the location.  We also need to consider how to protect ourselves and our cameras from the elements.</p>

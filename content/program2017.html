<h3>Advancement Program--Third Thursday of Month</h3>

<p class="DefaultText" style='text-align:left'>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society Advancement Program was set up as a way to stimulate the growth of photographic skills in our members. The advancement program is designed to let photographers display their favorite pictures and also to force photographers to photograph new and different subjects or "themes". Since these subjects may not be what the photographers would normally photograph, they challenge the photographers&rsquo; skills, creativity and imagination. We think it has been a good addition to our club. </p>
<p>The Advancement Program is set up as follows. At each meeting of the Advancement Program, we ask the participant to bring as many as three digital images or prints (8x10 or larger) to be evaluated by other club members.  The images are judged on a point system from 6 to 10. We comment on what is liked about the image and also how an image might be be improved or done differently. We seek a positive critiquing session.  Since all members see every image, we have the advantage of finding out what other images might be available for us to photograph. </p>
<p>For the odd-numbered months after January, (March, May, etc.) the images are "Photographer's Choice." Although such images can be brought in any time, a theme is specified for each of the other months.  Seeing how differently we each interpret the selected topic is interesting.  Also, this practice encourages scenic photographers to shoot some still life or people pictures and people photographers to look at other parts of their viewfinder.  Additionally, we  would like for all the images to have been shot within the last two years.</p>
<p>To encourage members to participate in club field trips, we double the point score for images taken on a club outing.  A person can thus get over 30 points in a single meeting.  </p>
<p>When a member presents 3 images each month for judging, the participant could earn as many as 300 points in a year.  We recognize such an accomplishment by awarding a Certificate of Achievement.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to come each third Thursday at 7:30 p.m. to Good Samaritan Society-Idaho Falls Village, 840 Elva Street, and share their images with other members. Everyone benefits by the sharing of this knowledge.  Even if you don&rsquo;t want to show your images, please come and observe what others are doing with their cameras.  You will learn something new and exciting!  Every year our membership changes enough so that there is a very fresh view of the world as seen through our photographers.

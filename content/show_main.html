<h2>October Show</h2>
<!--October Show is at the top of the page, in the middle of the template.... this is a problem -->
<p class="style2">The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society has in its over 25 years of
  existence had over 248 shows/presentations of photography to the public in Idaho Falls.
  We have presented over 3400 images shown to the public in these shows.  The club currently
  has a permanent photographic exhibit in the Emergency Room Hallway of Eastern Idaho Regional
  Medical Center, 3100 Channing Way. Club member photos also appear in the Eastern Idaho
  Technical Library, Alexander Creek Building Room 551, 1600 S 25th E, and in the Eastern
  Idaho Visitor at 425 North Capital Avenue, Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>EIPS participates in the First Thursday Gallery Walk sponsored by the Idaho Falls Arts Council.</p>
<p class="style2">The 2016 October Show and Sale will be the Eastern Idaho Photographic
  Society&rsquo;s 27th annual show. It is open to all photographers and is a way for
  photographers to have images judged.  The judging is open to the public and is an
  excellent  way to improve your images.</p>

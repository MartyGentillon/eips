<h2>2017 October Exposition</h2>
<!--October Show is at the top of the page, in the middle of the template.... this is a problem -->
<p>For 2017, the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society is doing an exposition instead of a show.  The 2017 October Exposition will be at the Eastern Idaho College Administration Building (Building #3).  It will be open to all photographers.  We encourage all photographers to enter the exposition.</p>
<p>The 2017 exposition will run from October 25 to November 22.  Camera club member Denise Meador works in the EIC administration building and will help get the pictures hung on October 25. She will be there from 1 to 7 pm.  When you come there with a picture, you can reach Denise by dialing 343. </p>

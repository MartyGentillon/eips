<!--October Show is at the top of the page, in the middle of the template.... this is a problem -->
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society has in its over 25 years of  existence had over 250 shows/presentations of photography to the public in Idaho Falls. We have presented over 3400 images shown to the public in these shows.  The club currently has a permanent photographic exhibit in the Emergency Room Hallway of Eastern Idaho Regional  Medical Center, 3100 Channing Way. Club member photos also appear in the Eastern Idaho Technical College Library, Alexander Creek Building Room 551, 1600 S 25th E, and in the Eastern Idaho Visitor Center at 425 North Capital Avenue, Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>The 2017 October Show and Sale will be the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society&rsquo;s 28th annual show. It is open to all photographers and is a way for photographers to have images judged.  The judging is open to the public.  The judges' comments provide excellent advice for improving your images.</p>

<h2>October Show</h2>
<!--October Show is at the top of the page, in the middle of the template.... this is a problem -->
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society has in its over 25 years of  existence had over 250 shows/presentations of photography to the public in Idaho Falls. We have presented over 3400 images shown to the public in these shows.</p>
<p>The 2017 October Show and Sale will be the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society&rsquo;s 28th annual show. It will be open to all photographers and is a way for photographers to have images judged.  The judging will be open to the public as well.  The judges' comments provide excellent advice for improving your images.</p>
